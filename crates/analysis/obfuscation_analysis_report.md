# Obfuscation Analysis Report

**Generated:** Wed Nov  5 07:53:56 PM WAT 2025  
**Iterations:** 2  
**Original Bytecode Length:** 11028 bytes  
**Transforms Used:** function_dispatcher (default) + shuffle  

## Summary Statistics

This analysis measures the longest contiguous byte sequence from the original bytecode that remains present in each obfuscated version, providing insights into how effectively the obfuscation transforms modify the bytecode structure.

### Sequence Length Metrics

- **Average Length:** 331.00 bytes
- **Median Length:** 331.00 bytes
- **Standard Deviation:** 0.00 bytes
- **Minimum Length:** 331 bytes
- **Maximum Length:** 331 bytes

### Distribution Percentiles

- **25th Percentile:** 331.00 bytes
- **75th Percentile:** 331.00 bytes
- **95th Percentile:** 331.00 bytes

## Top 10 Most Repeated Sequences

These sequences appear most frequently across all obfuscated versions, indicating bytecode patterns that persist through obfuscation.

| Rank | Length (bytes) | Frequency | Sequence (hex) |
|------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | 331 | 2 | `60806040526004361015610011575f80fd5b5...` |

## Seed Summary

- **Total seeds generated:** 2
- **Unique seeds:** 2
- **Sample seeds:** `0x0d92b987893e5c1803a6c3fc222b29f198846f14bf0a7dac525cef4958e2a7aa`, `0x0554dfd109b16be6391544fc68573f5c370dc117aeb58ab11bc8ed66b19c9bd9`

## N-gram Diversity Analysis

Measures the percentage of unique byte sequences of various lengths across all obfuscated versions. Higher diversity indicates more varied bytecode patterns.

- **2-byte sequences:** 12.66% unique
- **4-byte sequences:** 36.95% unique
- **8-byte sequences:** 61.08% unique

## Distribution Histogram

Distribution of longest common sequence lengths across all iterations:

```
 331- 331 bytes | ██████████████████████████████████████████████████ (2)
```

## Interpretation

The average longest common sequence represents **3.00%** of the original bytecode length. This indicates strong obfuscation with minimal sequence preservation.

The lower n-gram diversity suggests that obfuscation may produce similar patterns across different seeds, which could be exploited by analysts.
