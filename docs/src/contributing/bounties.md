# Bounties

We occasionally tag issues in the main repository with `bounty` when we want focused help on a feature, optimisation, or documentation push. To participate:

1. **Claim the issue** — comment on the ticket so we know you are working on it. Maintainers will confirm assignment or coordinate duplicates.
2. **Discuss scope early** — if the acceptance criteria are unclear, open a short design note in the issue before writing code. This avoids surprises when it is time to review.
3. **Work in the open** — draft PRs are encouraged; the team can give feedback on direction, dependencies, or missing context.
4. **Submit a PR** — reference the bounty issue number, describe the implemented approach, and include test/run notes (commands, outputs, benchmarks).

If you would like to propose a new bounty, open an issue prefixed with `[Bounty Proposal]` explaining the problem, expected deliverables, and suggested payout or contact the maintainers via the email listed in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. We'll review, tag, and announce it if it fits the roadmap.
