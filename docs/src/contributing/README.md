# Contributing

Thanks for helping harden Azoth. This section documents how the codebase is organised, how to build and test it locally, and where to focus contributions.

- [Architecture](./architecture.md) — crate layout and data flow.
- [Building](./building.md) — setting up toolchains and compiling the workspace.
- [Testing](./testing.md) — running unit/integration suites and linting.
- [Shortcuts](./shortcuts.md) — handy commands for day-to-day development.
- [Bounties](./bounties.md) — guidance for proposal-driven contributions.

Before opening a pull request, please skim `CONTRIBUTING.md` at the repository root and match the Rust style guidelines enforced there (formatting, Clippy, etc.).
