# Strip

The strip module removes non-runtime data from the detected sections so transforms work on the smallest possible surface area. `strip_bytecode` receives the raw byte vector and `Section` list, copies only the runtime spans into a clean buffer, and records everything else as `Removed` entries. The companion `CleanReport` captures enough metadata to reassemble the original artifact: runtime offsets and lengths, stripped bytes with their offsets and kinds, hashes of the clean runtime, and a program-counter mapping that relates original PCs to the stripped layout.

If no runtime section is found the function fails fast, preventing downstream passes from operating on empty input. After transforms produce a new runtime blob, `CleanReport::reassemble` (invoked through `encoder::rebuild`) restores the removed init code, constructor arguments, padding, and auxdata, updating CODECOPY/RETURN parameters when necessary so the deployment payload stays coherent with the modified runtime size.
